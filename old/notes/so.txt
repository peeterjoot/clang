I was trying out a sample from a [c++11 regex tutorial page][1], which I've reduced to

    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    #include <regex>

    using namespace std ;

    int main()
    {
       // This should match any word
       regex word("[[:alpha:]]+");
       string input = "hi 7 bye" ;

       // Replace with an empty string
       const string format = "" ;

       string clean_words = regex_replace( input, word, format, regex_constants::format_default ) ;
       cout << clean_words << endl ;

       return 0 ;
    }

However, when I try this out, it throws an exception.  It's not obvious to me what's wrong this call.  I'm using the clang trunk compiler, and gcc-4.7.2 libstc++.

... looks like this sample code is only valid for msvc++ at the moment.
